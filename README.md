I'm an Information Systems student living in Brazil. I'm learning how to code. I love creating and designing web pages with HTML, CSS, Sass, and JavaScript. It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I also enjoy coding in React, TypeScript because they challenge me more. I love it when I finally solve a difficult problem.

For my programming projects, I usually only push to Github when I make significant progress. For markdown files, I commit much more frequently. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.
